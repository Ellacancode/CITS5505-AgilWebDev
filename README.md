GitHub Flow

The GitHub flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub.
It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly.

The GitHub flow works like this:
* Create a new Branch
* Make changes and add Commits
* Open a Pull Request
* Review
* Deploy
* Merge
